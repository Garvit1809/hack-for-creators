# Creatify

## 💡 Inspiration

We have to build a site where people can not only know about the sea animals but also view and interact with the 3D models and imitate them in the real world using AR (Augmented Reality) technology.

## 💻 What it does

Our web app Creatify is built with features:

- It is a marketplace for Content creator and sponsors or brands.
- Content Creators can approach the brands they prefer or would like to collaborate
- Brands can look for Content Creators from different platforms at a single place for their marketing and collaboration
- Brands | Sponsors can get meaningful data about all the creators like total views, monthly views, followers at a same place.
- Brands can also filter creators acccording to their field of work. (filtering creators on the basis of their work like fitness, teaching, gaming etc)
- Content Creators can also look for AI generated ideas and funky images if they are not able to produce meaningful ideas
- We have also a focused accessory store for Content Creators from which they can buy items needed in Content Creation

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Frontend :- Wix and Wix API
- Backend :- Win Inbuilt Database
- AI :- Open AI API (for generating ideas and images)
- Auth0 :- For Google Authentication

## 🌐 Best Use of Velo by Wix

- **Wix Code**: Helps to add some custom code for implementing the backend and AR for the page.
- **Wix Data**: It may be used to both save data in a database and retrieve data from one.
- **Wix Stores**: We may use it to build the store and integrate it with the website.
- **Wix SEO**: I'm using Wix SEO to give the website SEO capability, and we can also use it to give the store SEO functionality.
- **Wix Users**: We may use it to add useful functionality to the store in addition to adding useful functionality to the website.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- All 4 of our team members were new to Velo by Wix, so it was very difficult working on it and had to learn first before implementing anything.
- We also hadnt used the OpenAI API before, so we were not familiar with that as well. We only had played woth the GPT not with the API😂
- Using the Wix internal API's also took a lot of time, querying the database, linking and mapping the data from the database.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We managed to create a full stack application within 36 hrs which is the fastest we have built anu website.
- We learnt 

## 📖 What we learned

- We learned to create a full stack website on Wix editor, managing Wix Database and linking and mapping dataset to UI quickly. 
- We also successfully integrated OpenAI API in WIx generating text and images.
