## üí° Inspiration

We have to build a site where people can not only know about the sea animals but also view and interact with the 3D models and imitate them in the real world using AR (Augmented Reality) technology.

## üíª What it does

Our web app Creatify is built with features:

- It is a marketplace for Content creator and sponsors or brands.
- Content Creators can approach the brands they prefer or would like to collaborate
- Brands can look for Content Creators from different platforms at a single place for their marketing and collaboration
- Brands | Sponsors can get meaningful data about all the creators like total views, monthly views, followers at a same place.
- Brands can also filter creators acccording to their field of work. (filtering creators on the basis of their work like fitness, teaching, gaming etc)
- Content Creators can also look for AI generated ideas and funky images if they are not able to produce meaningful ideas
- We have also a focused accessory store for Content Creators from which they can buy items needed in Content Creation

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- Frontend: Wix and Wix API
- Backend: Win Inbuilt Database
- AI API:- Open AI (for generating ideas and images)

## üåê Best Use of Velo by Wix

I have to use Velo by Wix to create a website. With Wix Velo, a full-stack development platform, you can create a website without knowing any code. It is a fantastic tool for both experienced developers who want to construct a website quickly and newbies who want to learn how to code. I am using the following features of Velo by Wix:

- **Wix Code**: Helps to add some custom code for implementing the backend and AR for the page.
- **Wix Data**: It may be used to both save data in a database and retrieve data from one.
- **Wix Stores**: We may use it to build the store and integrate it with the website.
- **Wix SEO**: I'm using Wix SEO to give the website SEO capability, and we can also use it to give the store SEO functionality.
- **Wix Users**: We may use it to add useful functionality to the store in addition to adding useful functionality to the website.
